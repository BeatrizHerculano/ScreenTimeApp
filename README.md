# Screen Time App

This app was developed as a technical assignment for Zario. The developed features are:

- Ask for authorization for app monitoring
- Select multiple apps for shielding
- Shield and Unshield the apps
- Store apps selected and how many times which app was opened on the device
- At the shield screen, give the user the option to close or open the blocked app

Beyond these features, I also researched the app monitoring and time limit for app usage with a daily reset (the resulting code is commented)

I used SwiftUI and The Composable Architecture for this application to create a modern and easy-to-understand code.
